# Project Title

Prediction of the Genetic Disorders in Children.

## Description

Genetics disease are the leading cause of the childhood mortality.  The genetic disorders in children include Alzheimer’s, cancer, Cystic fibrosis, diabetes, Hemochromatosis, Leber’s hereditary optic neuropathy, Leigh syndrome, Mitochondrial myopathy, and Tay-Sachs.  

The goal of this project is to determine the extent to which genetic disorders may be predicted (classified) from a combination of child diagnosis/context and parent gene trait. 


### Dependencies

#### Data Set:  
The data set is obtained from the www.kaggle.com and can be accessed in the following: 

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aibuzz/predict-the-genetic-disorders-datasetof-genomes?select=test_genetic_disorders.csv

#### Sample Characteristics
The data set includes 18,493 genetic disorder observations after eliminating the missing values.
The predictors include 43 prospective independent variables including 5 nominal-numeric, 2 continuous, 10 discrete (sets), 20 nominal-categorical, and 6 nominal (other) across patient and parent information. A preliminary analysis led to the immediate reduction of 14 of these variables as irrelevant to the study’s objective and leaving 29 for model consideration. 

#### Programming Language
R
